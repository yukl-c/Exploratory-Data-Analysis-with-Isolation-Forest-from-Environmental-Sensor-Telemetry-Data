Isolation Forest Exploratory Data Analysis from Environmental Sensor Telemetry Data with temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)

### Background
The data was taken with a sensor device from a physical environment with highly variable temperature and humidity from 12 to 19 July 2020. The data were taken for analysis with isolation forest.

### Data Preprocessing
Device 1c:bf:ce:15:ec:4d sensing in the environment with highly variable temperature and humidity was selected for analysis. The data of timestamp, temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) were selected for analysis with isolation forest. To reducing running time and cost, the data were sampled to 0.1 times to 10591 data. A new dataset was generated in csv format named place2_dataset2_10591.csv.
